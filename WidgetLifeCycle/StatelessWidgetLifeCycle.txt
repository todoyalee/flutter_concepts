The StatelessWidget Lifecycle
A StatelessWidget is built based on its own configuration and does 
not change dynamically. For example, the screen displays an image with 
a description and will not change. The stateless widget is declared with 
one class, and you’ll learn about classes in Chapter 3. The build (the UI 
portions) method of the stateless widget can be called from three different 
scenarios. It can be called the first time the widget is created, when the 
widget’s parent changes, and when an InheritedWidget has changed. 
In Chapter 15, “Adding State Management to the Firestore Client App,” 
you’ll learn how to implement the InheritedWidget.
The following sample code shows a StatelessWidget base structure, 
and Figure 1.1 displays the widget’s lifecycle.
class JournalList extends StatelessWidget {
 @override
 Widget build(BuildContext context) {
 return Container();
 }
}
